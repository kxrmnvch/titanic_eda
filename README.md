# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify the key factors that influenced passenger survival.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze the survival rate based on gender, passenger class, and age.
- Handle missing data and understand the structure of the dataset.
- Visualize key distributions and relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Dataset
Source: [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)  
File used: `train.csv`

## 📈 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.
- Passengers in first class were more likely to survive than those in lower classes.
- Younger passengers (children) had better survival odds compared to adults.
